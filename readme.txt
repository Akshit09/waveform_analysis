Somewhat crude THD+N calculator in Python

Measures the total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) for a given input signal, by guessing the fundamental frequency (finding the peak in the FFT), and notching it out in the frequency domain.

According to the never-wrong Wikipedia:

* THD is the fundamental alone vs the harmonics alone
* THD+N is the entire signal (not just the fundamental) vs the entire signal with the fundamental notched out.  (For low distortion, the difference between the entire signal and the fundamental is negligible.)

Example of usage, with sine wave generated by Adobe Audition, showing the 16-bit quantization distortion:

In [47]: run thdcalculator.py 'perfect 997.flac'
Frequency:	997.000000 Hz
THD+N:  	0.0022% or -93.3 dB

Comparing a test signal on an Audio Precision vs recorded into my 24-bit sound card with this script:

Claimed freq    Script freq    AP THD+N    Script THD+N
440.1    440.1    0.06%    0.06%
10003.9    10003.0    0.05%    0.07%
15000.0    14999.1        0.13%
19987.8    19986.0    0.22%    0.21%
10000.0    9999.1    8.16%    7.85%
997.0    996.9    0.06%    0.08%
100.0    100.0    0.15%    0.14%
